Susan stared out the train window in disbelief. The London she'd grown up with was nothing like this marred metropolis. The radio reports and newspapers had done little to prepare her for seeing this scorched, hellish ruin. Her breathing turned shallow, her chest filled with a fusion of shock and outrage.

Parades of Londoners who had spent the night in underground shelters were returning to their homes, or what was left of them. Susan saw two children sitting on the steps of a row house in ruins, the oldest girl consoling her baby brother by rocking him on her lap. Susan noticed the absence of parents and wiped tears from her eyes.

The train stopped several blocks before reaching their station due to a bomb that had taken out the tracks, leaving a crater the size of a bus. They stepped off the train to the wail of ambulance, police, and fire sirens. The scent of burnt wood and petrol made Susan want to hold her breath. A library across the street had been converted to a makeshift hospital; stretchers of wounded were being hauled inside by medics. Susan covered her mouth.

"There's nothing you can do," the lieutenant said, nudging her. "We need to go."

Susan reluctantly moved on.
